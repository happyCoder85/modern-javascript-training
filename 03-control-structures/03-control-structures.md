## Control Structures
Sometimes you want to perform a task so many times or based on a condition being met. That is where control structures come into play. We will be talking about the following type of structures.

    - For Loops
    - While Loops
    - Do/While Loops
    - IF/ELSE IF/ELSE Statements
    - Logical Operators
      - AND
      - OR
    - Break
    - Continue
    - Switch
